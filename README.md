us.jeffharris.hangman.Hangman-Java
======
**us.jeffharris.hangman.Hangman** is the simple find a word game played by children with pencil
and paper the world over. Is it the best? Probably not. Is the the fastest?
Probably not. However, I built it and it works.

This uses the `/usr/share/dict/american-english` word file from Ubuntu 19.04.
Most of the proper nouns and words with non-letter characters have been removed.
Maybe I missed one, maybe I didn't. There are 102401 lines of words in the
original file. If you find a non-letter character, file an
[issue](https://github.com/jefhar/hangman-java/issues) or a pull request.

## Usage
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jefhar/hangman-java.git
```
Then compile using your favorite compiler.

Have docker?
```
docker run -it jefhar/hangman:java
```
